Thanks for visiting! <br />  
As the sidebar bio alludes to, I'm a researcher interested in exploring the spatial and temporal aspects of environmental dynamics associated with anthropogenic change. By quantifying and attributing the causes and reactions in the environment to such events, we can better understand how to mitigate climate change. <br />  
Below, is an interactive dashboard of oil palm and deforestation in Campo Verde, in the Department of Ucayali in the Central Peruvian Amazon. Now, on its own this dashboard can't visualise the deforestation dynamics in this area but it does at least provide context. <br /> Ucayali is a known deforestation and oil palm expansion hotspot but oil palm has not been present here for long, compared to Colombia and Brazil. Which is why this area offers such an interesting insight to the politics of oil palm expansion, [see this journal article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X18301207) by Bennett et al. (2018) for their pivotal work in the area.
